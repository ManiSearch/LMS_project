# ResizeObserver Error Handling

## Problem

The application was experiencing "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications" errors. This error typically occurs when:

1. ResizeObserver callbacks trigger layout changes that cause more ResizeObserver notifications
2. Chart libraries (like Recharts) with ResponsiveContainer components resize frequently
3. Multiple ResizeObserver instances observe the same elements

## Root Cause

The primary source of these errors was identified as:

- **Recharts ResponsiveContainer** components used extensively in:
  - `client/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
  - `client/pages/DashboardOld.tsx` 
  - `client/pages/exams/Reports.tsx`
  - Other chart-heavy components

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Error Handler

Created `client/utils/resizeObserverErrorHandler.ts` that:

- Intercepts and suppresses ResizeObserver loop errors at the console level
- Handles unhandled promise rejections related to ResizeObserver
- Provides a safe ResizeObserver wrapper utility
- Is initialized in `client/App.tsx` at application startup

### 2. Error Boundary Component

Created `client/components/ResizeObserverErrorBoundary.tsx` that:

- Catches ResizeObserver-related errors at the component level
- Prevents application crashes from benign ResizeObserver loops
- Provides graceful error recovery for affected components
- Logs ResizeObserver errors as warnings rather than errors

### 3. Safe ResponsiveContainer Wrapper

Created `client/components/ui/safe-responsive-container.tsx` that:

- Wraps Recharts ResponsiveContainer with additional error handling
- Includes debouncing to prevent rapid resize events
- Uses the safe ResizeObserver utility
- Can be used as a drop-in replacement for ResponsiveContainer

## Implementation

### Automatic Error Suppression

```typescript
// Initialized automatically in App.tsx
import { initializeResizeObserverErrorHandler } from "@/utils/resizeObserverErrorHandler";
initializeResizeObserverErrorHandler();
```

### Component-Level Protection

```tsx
import ResizeObserverErrorBoundary from '@/components/ResizeObserverErrorBoundary';

// Wrap chart components
<ResizeObserverErrorBoundary>
  <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
    <BarChart data={data}>
      {/* chart content */}
    </BarChart>
  </ResponsiveContainer>
</ResizeObserverErrorBoundary>
```

### Safe Container Alternative

```tsx
import SafeResponsiveContainer from '@/components/ui/safe-responsive-container';

// Drop-in replacement
<SafeResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
  <BarChart data={data}>
    {/* chart content */}
  </BarChart>
</SafeResponsiveContainer>
```

## Files Modified

1. **Core Infrastructure:**
   - `client/utils/resizeObserverErrorHandler.ts` - Main error handling utility
   - `client/App.tsx` - Initialize error handler

2. **Error Boundary Components:**
   - `client/components/ResizeObserverErrorBoundary.tsx` - React error boundary
   - `client/components/ui/safe-responsive-container.tsx` - Safe wrapper component

3. **Updated Components:**
   - `client/pages/DashboardOld.tsx` - Added error boundaries around ResponsiveContainer
   - `client/pages/exams/Reports.tsx` - Added error boundaries around ResponsiveContainer

## Benefits

1. **User Experience:** Eliminates console errors that were alarming but harmless
2. **Stability:** Prevents potential application crashes from ResizeObserver loops
3. **Development:** Cleaner console output during development
4. **Maintainability:** Centralized error handling that can be easily configured
5. **Performance:** Debounced resize handling reduces unnecessary re-renders

## Configuration

The error suppression can be controlled:

```typescript
import { 
  enableResizeObserverErrorSuppression, 
  disableResizeObserverErrorSuppression 
} from '@/utils/resizeObserverErrorHandler';

// Disable suppression for debugging
disableResizeObserverErrorSuppression();

// Re-enable suppression
enableResizeObserverErrorSuppression();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Wrap Chart Components:** Always wrap ResponsiveContainer with ResizeObserverErrorBoundary
2. **Use Safe Wrapper:** Consider using SafeResponsiveContainer for new chart implementations
3. **Monitor Performance:** Watch for excessive resize events that might indicate performance issues
4. **Test Responsiveness:** Ensure charts still resize properly after applying error boundaries

## Notes

- ResizeObserver loop errors are typically benign and don't affect functionality
- The solution preserves all intended resize behavior while suppressing error noise
- Error boundaries provide graceful degradation if genuine errors occur
- The global error handler is the primary defense, with component-level boundaries as backup
